Hello there, yes I've finally gotten round to putting my thoughts on the Interweb and have starting a blog.  Only been doing this IT thing for what 13 years professionally and this has been a long standing 'to do', some might say it's about time.  

The main reason for my newly found impetus is to blog more about my work, the technologies I use and the projects I work on.  However, to mix it up  I expect I will be musing about my other non coding interests from time to time.

Well if you've continued to read this so far, then thanks and long may it continue!  Feel free to get in touch with me on the usual channels :-)
